bubble sort algorithm step by step for the array [5, 3, 1, 8, 2]:

Step 1:

Compare 5 and 3, swap because 3 is smaller.
Array becomes: [3, 5, 1, 8, 2]
Compare 5 and 1, swap because 1 is smaller.
Array becomes: [3, 1, 5, 8, 2]
Compare 8 and 2, swap because 2 is smaller.
Array becomes: [3, 1, 5, 2, 8]

Step 2:

Compare 3 and 1, swap because 1 is smaller.
Array becomes: [1, 3, 5, 2, 8]
Compare 5 and 2, swap because 2 is smaller.
Array becomes: [1, 3, 2, 5, 8]

Step 3:

Compare 3 and 2, swap because 2 is smaller.
Array becomes: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

Step 4:

Compare 1 and 2, no swap needed.
Array remains: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]

The array is now sorted. The bubble sort algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.
