1. Given array is  [6, 8, 3, 1, 4]
lets apply Bubble sort algorithm 
now the index of given array is starts from 0 to 3 because the size of array is 4 .

Step 1:

Compare 6 and 8, no swap needed.
Array remains: [6, 8, 3, 1, 4]
Step 2:

Compare 8 and 3, swap because 3 is smaller.
Array becomes: [6, 3, 8, 1, 4]
Step 3:

Compare 8 and 1, swap because 1 is smaller.
Array becomes: [6, 3, 1, 8, 4]
Step 4:

Compare 8 and 4, swap because 4 is smaller.
Array becomes: [6, 3, 1, 4, 8]
Step 5:

Compare 6 and 3, swap because 3 is smaller.
Array becomes: [3, 6, 1, 4, 8]
Step 6:

Compare 6 and 1, swap because 1 is smaller.
Array becomes: [3, 1, 6, 4, 8]
Step 7:

Compare 6 and 4, swap because 4 is smaller.
Array becomes: [3, 1, 4, 6, 8]
Step 8:

Compare 6 and 8, no swap needed.
Array remains: [3, 1, 4, 6, 8]
Now, the array is sorted in ascending order using the bubble sort technique.
